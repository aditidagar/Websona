## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 20, 2020
 * Where: Online - Zoom Meeting

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well


##### 1. Pair Programming

At a very early stage, we decided to tackle every issue via peer programming. We split up into pairs wherein one person assumed the role of a driver while the other assumed the role of a navigator. Before actually beginning to code both the driver and navigator discussed how to solve the issue at hand. While the driver would code, the navigator would look for any bugs or discrepencies before swapping roles. This not only ensured fewer mistakes and bugs but also helped streamline our work. Moreover because two people were assigned the same issue, deadliens were met on time as the driver and navigator were accountable to each other. Overall, we witnessed significant improvement in the quality of PR's that were put up for approval.

##### 2. Weekly Zoom Calls

Another practice that we have been consistent with and that has proven to be extremely helpful was doing weekly group zoom calls prior to our zoom call with our partners. This gave us the oppurtunity to stay updated on what progress was made that particular week while also splitting up work for the next week. We also utilised this time to prepare for the presentation that we would give to our partners. This ensured that all team members were on the same page and we could provide insightful details to our partners regarding the application. Moreover, weekly zoom meetings also helped boost team morale throughout the term.

##### 3. Defining Coding Standards

One of the very first things that we discussed as a team was coding standards for this project. We decided on using Typescript for the backend. With that came the necessity to clearly define all types so as to make it easier for others to understand our code while also making debugging more convenient. We also decided on applying branch protection on GitHub to ensure that no team member accidentally pushes code to Master. Defining and obeying these coding standards led to efficient programming and error fixing.  

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

##### 1. Using ClickUp

Using ClickUp as a collaboration and project management tool proved to be not as successful as we hoped. Although team members met the deadlines set on ClickUp for their respective user stories, it was a tedious process to update these user stories. Members of the team often forgot to update their user stories and often mislabeled them. Updating ClickUp felt like a redundant task as our weekly meetings kept the group updated. Infact the delayed updates to the ClickUp board only led to more confusions regarding the weekly progress made.

##### 2. Three Strike Rule

Initially, we set out to strictly implement the three strike rule for missed meetings and deadlines. However, in retrospect, we realized that no member of the team ever missed the deadlines without a valid excuse. Moreover, each time some other member volunteered to finish off the pending work. Having seen this, and taking into consideration on going issues related to COVID-19, we realised the policy was indeed too harsh. As a team, we decided to no longer implement the three Strike Rule.


#### Q3. Planned changes

##### 1. Merge early, merge often

Since we noticed an unusually high number of merge conflicts, we decided to review our branching strategy. We realised that if one member's code is going to have a significant impact on other developer's code then it must be merged at the soonest so that everyone can use the new version. We have decided to better prioritise our branches and check code into version control almost daily to enhance our productivity.

##### 2. Dedicated Testing

We have decided to slightly modify the way we have been testing our code. We will have a diiferent person than the one who wrote the code for an issue test it so that it is completely unbiased. Biased testing is particularly common when a developer is writing tests for code that they wrote. We have also decided to focus on building extensive unit and intensive tests for all exisitng and and new funcitonality. 


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

For our demo, we slpit into two groups. We had front-end developers discuss and plan out their part of the presentatiopn while the back-end developers prepared theirs. Finally we had a team meeting where we put all of it together into one presentation. This way it was easier to deligate work amongst team members. As part of our presentation we explained to our partners all the existing features of the app. We also incorporated screen sharing of the emulator so that they could provide feedback on the UI too. Our partners were more than satisfied with the progress made on the app so far and even appreciated specific design choices we made.
We did receive some constructive feedback regarding the UI and how it could be slightly modfied to fit our partners' needs. Overall the presentation was a success and we learned that our preparation for it was impeccable. Good team work and advanced plannning allowed us to do full justice to presenting our application.
