## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 20, 2020
 * Where: Online - Zoom Meeting

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

##### 1.Pair Programming
Very early on, our team decided to split up the team into groups of 2. This decision has now been proven to be one of the most efficient choices this team has made. Having every member be personally accountable for another, streamlined our work, ensured all deadlines were met, and allowed team members to share resources. With pair programming, we noticed significantly fewer mistakes and bugs, and the quality of all code put up for 'PR's' was almost always bug-free.

##### 2.Weekly Zoom Calls
Having weekly zoom calls within the team a day prior to our weekly zoom calls with Websona has also been a process-related decision that has turned out to be successful. With these meetings, we've been able to stay updated on progress made on all fronts. Furthermore, these meetings have given us a chance to prepare what we present every week to Websona. These meetings have allowed us to also brainstorm solutions as a team and discuss implementation alternatives. All in all, weekly Zoom meetings have been a way to stay updated and boost team morale throughout the term.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

##### 1. Using ClickUp
Using ClickUp as a collaboration and project management tool has been proven to be not as successful as we hoped. Although team members met the deadlines set on ClickUp for their respective user stories, it was a tedious process to update these user stories. Members of the team often forgot to update their user stories and often mislabeled them. Updating ClickUp felt like a redundant task as our weekly meetings kept the group updated.

##### 2. 3 Strike Rule
Initially, we set out to strictly implement the three strike rule for missed meetings and deadlines. However, in retrospect, we realized that no member of the team ever missed the deadlines without a valid excuse. Having seen this, and taking into consideration on going issues related to COVID-19. As a team, we no longer implemented the 3 Strike Rule.


#### Q3. Planned changes

We are not making any changes that haven't already been mentioned above.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
